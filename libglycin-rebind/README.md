# Rust libglycin bindings

The Rust bindings for [libglycin](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/glycin).

This package contains safe Rust bindings for the libglycin C library.

Since glycin is written in Rust, the native [`glycin`] crate is available to use the same features. One of the main purposes of *libglycin-rebind* is to reduce the binary sice.

To use this package, the *libglycin-2* library has to be available on the system.
If you use the native [`glycin`] crate, this is not required.
