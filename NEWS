## 1.1.0 (2024-09-13)

### Fixed

- tests: Update to test image which uses an explicit font name in SVG, not
  depending on the correct default font setting on the system for the test to
  pass.

### Changed

- glycin-utils: Don't use regex feature of env-logger to save almost 1 MB binary
  size in each loader

## 1.1.beta (2024-08-02)

### Added

- Add tests for animations
- Automatically detect if glycin is used inside a Flatpak development
  environment and disable sandbox in that case. Otherwise, flatpak-spawn
  wouldn't use the loaders from the right Flatpak or might not find a installed
  Flatpak at all.
- Capture the stderr and stdout from loaders and editors and included it in the
  new ErrorCtx type that the API now returns

### Fixed

- Also include free swap as free memory in the calculation of how much memory a
  loader can use
- If the fontconfig cache was not up-to-date, rendering SVGs with text would
  fail. There is now a loader config option to enable passing a writable
  fontconfig cache dir into the loader sandbox. This fixes the issue. The cache
  is per loader binary.
- Sealing memfds sometimes fails. Is is solved via retrying the seal until it
  works. In the past this was limited to very short time of retries. The
  interval is now much longer and properly async.
- There was an error in the hardcoded limit for the texture size. The limit is
  now fixed and 8GB as intended.

## 1.1.alpha (2024-06-28)

### Added

- A specific error if no loaders are configured instead of giving an unknown
  format error
- Bindings for C and other languages via GObject Introspection under the name
  libglycin and libglycin-gtk4
- Loaders are now accompanied by editors that can return an image with image
  operations applied
- Option to use tokio throughout instead of async-io
- glycin: List of mime types `glycin::DEFAULT_MIME_TYPES` that the default
  loaders support
- glycin: New loader option to apply transformations like rotate/mirror from
  metadata by default
- loaders: Use specific OutOfMemory error type

### Changed

- jxl: Libjxl version 0.10 is now required
- svg: Use C bindings in SVG loader to reduce binary size
